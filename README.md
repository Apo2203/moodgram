# MOODGRAM
## MOODGRAM is a project for the Kaunas University of Technology

Moodgram is a social network that allows partners to fight each other by sharing funny images born from their thought.
Particularly, once a couple is signed up on the social, they have to write on the site, every day, their state of mind thinking about each other.
An online Artificial Intelligence will generate an image from the text.
Once both update their state of mind MOODGRAM will create a single post with the two images.
Public on the platform (followers of the couple), have to vote for one of this image.
The most voted image will win.
